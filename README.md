# Transitor

Transitor is a Java-based routing engine for Maastricht, the Netherlands. It accepts a start and end location in the form of a postocde and returns the fastest route between them. The application accepts walk, cycle, and bus as modes of transport.

## Usage

Transitor was created with Maastricht University project specifications in mind, therefore it can not be run outside of the conditions of the project (due to the need for a running MySQL server with modified GTFS data for the Netherlands). 

Feel free to use the code as a reference for your own projects and learn from it!
